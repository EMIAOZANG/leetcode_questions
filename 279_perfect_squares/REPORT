LeetCode 279: Perfect Squares

Description
===========
Given a positive integer n, find the least number of perfect square numbers (for example, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...) which sum to n.
For example, given n = 12, return 3 because 12 = 4 + 4 + 4; given n = 13, return 2 because 13 = 4 + 9.

Methods
=======
Dynamic Programming, Math

Solution
========
Maintain 2 Vectors, one (PS) for memorizing all perfect square numbers, one (A[1,...,n]) for memorizing answers for each number
Then we do the following

For each i from 1 to n:
    if i is a square (check with int(sqrt(i))^2==i):
        Then Append i to PS.
        A[i] = 1
    else
        A[i] = min(1+A[i-PS[j]]) among all possible PS[j]
    return A[n]
